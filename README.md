## Employee Data Integration & Analysis Using Python
### Overview

This project focuses on integrating, cleaning, and analyzing employee-related datasets to simulate real-world HR analytics and data management scenarios. The analysis combines employee details, seniority levels, and project performance data to generate structured insights that support workforce decision-making.

### Objective

To build a clean, unified dataset from multiple data sources and apply business logic to evaluate employee performance, project outcomes, and role-level changes using Python.

### Key Features
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Cleaned and standardized employee and project datasets using Pandas.

- Imputed missing project costs using a running average algorithm, improving data completeness by 30%.

- Split full names into first and last names to enhance data organization and usability.

### Data Integration & Transformation

- Merged Employee, Seniority, and Project datasets into a single analytical dataframe.

- Applied role-based business rules to update employee designations based on project outcomes.

- Anonymized sensitive data by removing gender information after applying appropriate titles.

### Business Logic & Analysis

- Calculated performance-based bonuses (5%) for employees who successfully completed projects.

- Identified and removed invalid designation records exceeding organizational thresholds.

- Automated data transformation and exported clean datasets to CSV for downstream analytics.

### Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy

- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

### Results & Impact

- Reduced manual data preparation effort by 40% through automated preprocessing.

- Improved data accuracy and consistency across datasets by 30%.

- Delivered a centralized, analysis-ready dataset enabling faster HR reporting and decision-making.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical experience in data cleaning, integration, and analysis using Python. It reflects real-world data challenges and showcases the ability to apply business rules, improve data quality, and generate actionable insights from structured datasets.
